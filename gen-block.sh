# To get rid of the continously tracking the i.e. the tracking configuratio   #
# on the dataprotecion popup from www.focus.de where dozen of trackers are    #
ä listed. Even   
# This project exists because I wanted a means of ad-blocking on Android that #
# didn't require me to root my new phone, thus voiding its warranty.          #
# This project is was designed to grab a lot of the popular hosts files from  #
# the Intenet, combine them into one big hosts file, and then convert the     #
# hosts file into a configuration file that Unbound understands. If you want  #
# to go with hosts-based or DNS-based ad blocking, this script covers both.   #
# Of course, you should still look into some sort of in-browser ad-blocking,  #
# just for the sake of having defense in depth.                               #
# I was inspired by the following GitHub projects:                            #
